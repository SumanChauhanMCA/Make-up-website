			<h2 id="step1">STEP 1: EYESHADOW</h2>
			<p>
				<img src="EYESHADOW.jpg" height="500px" width="800px"><br><br>
				Eyeshadow can add interest to your makeup look, whether you opt for neutral shades or go bold with colorful hues. Whichever look you use, grab two complementary eyeshadows: one lighter shade, and one darker shade.

				Dip your eyeshadow brush into the light shade, then tap the brush to get rid of any excess product. Apply the lighter shadow across the entire lid, starting at the lash line and ending just above the crease of your eyelid.

				Now dip your brush into the darker color, tapping off the excess once again. Apply the color at the outer corner of your eye, just above your lash line. Sweep the darker color across your eyelid crease, just under the brow bone. Stop application around the center of your eyelid, as you don’t want to darken the inner corners. Take a clean shadow brush and blend the two shades together. If you’d like a more intense look, reapply the darker shadow once more.
			</p>

			<h2 id="step2">STEP 2: EYELINER</h2>
			<p>
				<img src="EYELINER.jpg" height="500px" width="800px"><br><br>
				Applying eyeliner can be difficult—one little mistake and you’re stuck with “raccoon” eyes. Banish your eye makeup woes with these essential tips for applying eyeliner.

				Types of Eyeliner

				Liquid eyeliner: If you’re looking for precision, liquid eyeliner is your new best friend. You can find liquid liner in bottle form, which is applied with a fine dipping brush. You can also find liquid liner in a marker-type pen.

				How to apply: With liquid eyeliner, start thin at the inner corner of your eye, then make the application thicker towards the outer corner. You can start lining at the middle of your eye, or in the inner corner, and keep the liner tip or brush as close to the lash line as possible. Use small strokes of your liner to create small dashes along the lash line, then connect them to fill in the gaps. If your hand slips, don’t worry! Apply a bit of eye makeup remover to a Q-tip and clean up the area.
				Gel eyeliner: This type of eyeliner typically comes in a small pot, with a thin brush for application. Gel eyeliner is fantastic for creating a cat-eye look.

				How to apply: Dip a flat, angular brush into the gel eyeliner pot. Swirl the brush to ensure both sides have product on them, and start application in the middle of the lash line, working outwards. Then, draw a line from the inner corner of your eye towards the middle, connecting the two lines.
				Pencil eyeliner: This is typically the best eyeliner option for beginners. A sharp pencil eyeliner is easy to use on your waterline, and is great for creating a smoky eye.

				How to apply: Sharpen your liner pencil each time you use it. After pulling your eyelid taut, draw small light dots starting at the outer corner of your upper eyelid. Work your way into the inner corner of your eye to create a thin dotted line, as close to the lash line as possible. Connect the dots with your pencil or use a small shadow brush to blend them in.
			</p>

			<h2 id="step3">STEP 3: MASCARA</h2>
			<p>
				<img src="MASCARA.jpg" height="500px" width="800px"><br><br>
				If you’re going to use only one makeup product, mascara should be at the top of your list. A few swipes of mascara can make your eyes look brighter in a single step.

				You can find mascara in a variety of colors, but black and brown tend to be the most popular. Start by curling your eyelashes with an eyelash curler.

				How to curl your eyelashes:

				Place the curler at the base of your upper lashes, being careful not to grab any of the sensitive skin around your eyelid
				Slowly close the curler
				Hold it in place for a few seconds
				Release gently
				After your eyelashes are curled, grab your tube of mascara. Gently swirl the wand around to ensure all the bristles are coated in mascara. Pro Tip: Don’t pump the wand into the tube, as this allows air to get in and may cause your mascara to clump.

				Wriggle the mascara brush lightly across the roots of your lashes. This will create more volume, which you can then pull through to the ends of your lashes. If your lashes clump together, grab a clean wand and brush through them. Apply a second coat for more volume.
			</p>

			<h2 id="step4">STEP 4: KAJAL</h2>
			<p>
				<img src="KAJAL.jpg" height="500px" width="800px"><br><br>
				
				1) Pick a kajal pencil for a controlled look. Pencils are the easiest kajal to use, especially for beginners. They are applied like regular eyeliner pencils. They can create thin or tight lines, and they do not wear off as easily. They may not be as good for smoky or smudged looks, however.
				Pencils are a great choice if you want to edge your water line.
				You will need to sharpen the pencil occasionally.
				2) Get a liquid or gel kajal for a more dramatic look. Liquid and gels create thicker and darker looks. They are easier to blend than kajal pencils, but they may smudge more throughout the day. It is also not a good idea to apply gel or liquid kajal directly to your water line, as it may cause irritation.
				Some gels and liquids will come with their own wands. If they don't, you will need to get an eyeliner brush to apply them.
				3) Choose kajal powders for a traditional look. If you want to create a smoky look, you might consider traditional kajal powders. These powders are good if you want a traditional, dark eye. They will not form straight or perfect lines, but they will give you a thick and bold edging.[3]
Kajal powders usually come with an applicator wand. They can also be applied using an eyeliner brush.
				4) Find a waterproof formula if you sweat or cry easily. A waterproof formula may help prevent smudging or prevent the kajal from running if your eyes start to water. These formulas are ideal for people who exercise often or for people who have allergies or sensitive eyes. Waterproof versions may be more difficult to wash off, however.
You can find waterproof versions of all types of kajal, even traditional powders.
